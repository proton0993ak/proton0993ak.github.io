                                Rapid change dominates the health care landscape, but for  organizations willing to take on challenges and leverage disruptive trends, the  Outlook for 2017 and beyond is positive. Despite their considerable size and  resources, world life science companies operate in a dynamic environment that  presents numerous challenges to revenue and market share growth. There are six  potential issues for 2017: Market reconfiguration and consolidation; pricing  pressures; health reform and the shift to value; R&#38;D productivity;  disruptive technologies; as well as risk, regulations, and compliance will tend  to shape the life sciences and health care industry in the coming year and  beyond.
                            </p>

                        Nobilis Global, consulting to life science companies, operates  in a dynamic environment that presents numerous opportunities for growth. To  capture these opportunities Nobilis Global is concentrated on areas with each  individual entity in which they excel, improving areas that are important to  achieving their goals, and letting go of elements that might be holding then  back. 
                            </p>

                                    Market reconfiguration and consolidation are driving companies to search for the right scale. This could mean narrowing to a core set of capabilities or therapeutic areas or building them out by acquiring and managing a large portfolio of businesses. Each approach is resulting in an unprecedented level of deal-making in the form of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures, factoring, debt consolidation and licensing agreements.1 In addition, emerging markets are fueling the growth of local companies that are expected to shift the U.S. centric “skew” of the global competitive landscape and open  up new Mergers &#38; Acquisitions (M&#38;A) opportunities.

                            <p class="header_item-text">
                                    Innovating in specialty (versus primary care) therapeutic areas may drive considerable pharmaceutical revenue growth in coming years, however the alternative market continues to steady growth alongside traditional methodologies. Meanwhile, some biotech companies are moving to M&#38;A and opening innovation models as a way to help overcome organic productivity challenges and spur product and market growth. A number of medtech companies are integrating R&#38;D, marketing, engineering, and other disciplines to more effectively connect customer insights with the biodesign process. In addition, Nobilis Global as well as others, is looking for ways to wrap health care services (e.g., cellular therapy, anti-aging, photon light therapy, stem cell therapy, electromagnetic therapies, nanotechnology, etc.) around their products <br>
                                    “As the health care industry shifts and transforms so, too, must the life sciences sector. In 2017, this will require companies to recalibrate business models and research priorities, as well as retool commercial practices to better articulate their value proposition.”

                                    In addition to this idea, Nobilis Global expects to use real-world evidence to demonstrate a product’s clinical, safety, and economic impact (e.g., comparative effectiveness), and robust data analytics to improve marketing strategies and effectiveness. Nobilis Global will consider M&#38;A transactions to scale up within particular areas of specialization and exit others, and expand into new markets as well as engage in more proactive risk management and regulatory compliance.

                            <p class="header_item-text">
                                    In another key focus area, Nobilis Global will improve R&#38;D efficiency, diversify risks and costs and use their human capital better by employing open innovation and other novel development approaches – for example, hosting companies on site or establishing innovation centers that incubate 30-40 companies to broaden future possibilities. In pursuit of innovative new products, Nobilis Global will look to develop patient-centric suites/portfolios of products and services to improve the overall health of their customers. For example, there is growing interest in wearable technologies and sensors to monitor vital signs; digital medicines such as ingestible smart pills with microchips; and novel drug delivery systems using electromagnetic and scalar technologies, not counting the miracles stem cell technology will bring to mankind.

                                    Nobilis Global sees “big data” becoming an integral part of life sciences organizations encompassing the entire value chain. Regulatory compliance and patient safety will become board room topics. Nobilis Global will look to other industries and non-traditional players for disruptive technologies that could be applied to health care and foster product innovation, market expansion, and revenue growth. For example, its innovative Lymph Infrared Photon Emitting (LIPHE) Machine, a lymph detoxification instrument, is expected to be a valuable partner in health care’s shift towards a patient-centered, value-based delivery model. LIPHE has the potential to improve workplace efficiencies and increasing revenue for doctors of all practices, increase patient safety with its non- invasive photon technology, better coordinate care, facilitate payments, and engage patients to take charge of their health with a holistic methodology.

                                    In an era of specialty pharmaceuticals, Nobilis Global stands to evaluate their role with regard to social responsibility and considers the overall impact of their corporation’s reputation. Finally, given the level of transformation occurring in the overall health care industry, Nobilis Global as a life science company pro-actively addresses many aspects of their strategy in order to maximize opportunities for their success. Growth in the life sciences sector — comprised of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical technology (medtech) segments — is closely tied to economic and demographic drivers that fuel a continual transformation of the broader health care industry. Life sciences companies have demonstrated their ability to survive and thrive amidst recent periods of economic recession, health care spending cutbacks, geographic market swings, and changing population profiles. If history is any indication, 2017-18 will again test the sector’s ability to adapt in an era of transformation, Nobilis Global stands ready for the challenge.

                                The second area of interest for Nobilis Global is Media which needs to be ready for new economic models coming their way, as demand for content anywhere and anytime accelerates. Gerald Belson, vice chairman and U.S. Media &#38; Entertainment leader at Deloitte Consulting, LLP, shares his perspectives on growth opportunities and emerging trends. “In last year’s outlook, we stressed that the media and entertainment sector is in a rare moment where existing business models continue to thrive at the same time that new models are emerging. The traditional model still dominates, but movement to an online “over the top” (OTT) model is hastening.”

                                Weakening prices and a sluggish outlook for demand growth have turned investors away from the mining sector. The S&#38;P/TSX Global Mining Index fell by about 10 percent through the end of November 2014, while the S&#38;P 500 rose by 11 percent. Then in 2016-17, it again surged up and down driven by world economics.  Given these market conditions, investors question the sector’s ability to address a decade-long productivity decline, improve capital efficiency, revive sinking shareholder returns, and service mounting debt and interest obligations.

                                    Market reconfiguration and consolidation are driving companies to search for the right scale. This could mean narrowing to a core set of capabilities or therapeutic areas or building them out by acquiring and managing a large portfolio of businesses. Each approach is resulting in an unprecedented level of deal-making in the form of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures, factoring, debt consolidation and licensing agreements.1 In addition, emerging markets are fueling the growth of local companies that are expected to shift the U.S. centric “skew” of the global competitive landscape and open  up new Mergers &#38; Acquisitions (M&#38;A) opportunities.

Meanwhile, some biotech companies are moving to M&#38;A and opening innovation models as a way to help overcome organic productivity challenges and spur product and market growth. A number of medtech companies are integrating R&#38;D, marketing, engineering, and other disciplines to more effectively connect customer insights with the biodesign process.

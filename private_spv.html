                <p><strong>SUMMARY </strong><br>
                
                    In support of   facilitating the investment relationship with the Licensee and the Bank, the   following deliverables and requirements should be established and agreed upon   by all members and participants.  This   is a Special Vehicle Company (SPV) established for the client, which is a bank   and platform requirement to enter into contract with the Licensee and Bank.
                </p>
                <p><strong>TIME LINE GOAL </strong><br>
                
                    This investment   company should be functioning and creating revenues in Sept 2017, and   thereafter, if all time lines that are agreed upon are met in a diligent   manner.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>USA PROCESS AND REQUIREMENTS:</strong>
                </p>

                <div class="spv-text__content">
                    <p>
                            1)  Create   a name for the Trust SPV – Ownership is yours and will always be yours; you   have complete control of your money and company at all times.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                            2)  Decide   on Directors, one being your Trustee and another a UK auditing firm set up to   keep all records, transactions and payments in <strong>P &amp; L</strong> (<strong>P</strong>rofit and <strong>L</strong>oss) fashion,   as well as someone to direct the program investment.&nbsp; This person cannot move or utilize the funds   of the SPV, but only follow the direction of a Board Resolution or written   directive by the account Signatory, who is required to authorize the Program   Director.&nbsp; The Program Director who,   with the other Directors, will lead the process. &nbsp;We can offer the services of someone already   approved, but it can be anyone you trust and who you believe will pass the <strong>KYC</strong> (<strong>K</strong>now <strong>Y</strong>our <strong>C</strong>ustomer). It is also suggested you   appoint a Compliance Officer to be a Director whose job will be to make sure   all paperwork is in order at all times. They will have no signatory rights. <br>
                            <br>
                            All passports, ID’s, etc. will be required   from each person for each step of this process, therefore their KYC must be   very clean and as few people as possible on the Board.&nbsp; If one member is not cleared, all involved   and the company will be black listed.&nbsp;   Lloyds of London is the KYC processor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            3) With   this information, the SPV can be created to represent the account holder.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                            4)  The   SPV Bank Account will supply the <strong>POF</strong> (<strong>P</strong>roof <strong>Of</strong> <strong>F</strong>unds) at the point   where it is necessary, but is not required at this stage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            5)  Request   your bank to assist you to coordinate banking in the UK (preferably their   correspondent bank) so this will go smoothly into your new company SPV account;   as well as create a flow for funds returning to the origination or, &nbsp;wherever you designate.&nbsp; Your bank will be vital in opening a <strong>UK</strong> (<strong>U</strong>nited <strong>K</strong>ingdom) bank   account and make the transaction one that will not require so much KYC red   tape in transfers of the size contemplated.&nbsp; <strong>HSBC </strong>(<strong>H</strong>ong <strong>K</strong>ong <strong>S</strong>hanghai <strong>B</strong>ank <strong>C</strong>orp), Standard   Charter or Barclays are preferred.&nbsp; <strong>HKMA</strong> (<strong>H</strong>ong <strong>K</strong>ong <strong>M</strong>onetary <strong>A</strong>uthority) will oversee HSBC and be in charge of all paperwork for   your profit to be sent wherever you desire and assist clearing the FED,   Homeland Security, or any other governmental agency requirement.&nbsp; These agencies oversee these transactions   and are part of this endeavor and fully aware of the transaction because it is   in US Dollars.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            6)  If   so appointed, Nobilis Directors will travel to the UK and set up the complete   program for you, and then your Trustee can move the funds into your new   account.  They will, at some point, have   to fill in the signature card for the new account, and go through the KYC   Process which can be eliminated to a large part if your bank assists.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            7)  The   new company (SPV) must be prepared to wire additional funds as the company   must be a functioning company.&nbsp; The initial   amount must remain between 50 and 100 million which will be either blocked in   the account (most desirable) or moved to an attorney escrow account, but   always under your control.&nbsp; In either   case, for 30 days the full amount must be in the blocked account.&nbsp; Therefore, extra funds should remain in the   account unblocked for administrative costs, Lloyds of London insurance (<strong>PPI</strong> – <strong>P</strong>ayment <strong>P</strong>rotection <strong>I</strong>nsurance to the original SPV in case   of an Act of God), bonds if needed, escrow costs if required, etc.&nbsp; Whatever is left, can be added to the   contract, used for other investments, or simply utilized for administration of   the company costs which will include attorneys, auditors and accounting.&nbsp; Investment profits will go into a special   account only accessed by the owners or wired anywhere in the world.&nbsp; These administrative costs can be arranged to   be replaced from the profits generated and returned to the original SPV   account.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            8)  Any   person, who introduces the Parties, will sign an Intermediary form and a   number will be assigned to them.  The   licensee and bank will be responsible for payment to the intermediary, and the   number registered to them will go into the Client file for all transactions. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            9)  This   relationship can be what we design it to be because the transaction is dealing   with <u>principals only</u>.&nbsp; The   license holder (trading entity), will have a contract with the SPV direct for   a percentage of the bank contract to oversee the platform, and the Licensee   signs off at the end of the platform.&nbsp;   Everything will be transparent as to this percentage and much depends   on how strong the named directors are and if a bond must be arranged on the   license holder side for them.&nbsp; After the   funds are secured, the process of a contract with the bank and the licensee   will be offered to the SPV, whereupon the SPV will receive its contract to   sign, and after all&nbsp; governances have   stamped their approval, the Medium Term Notes, traded by ONLY Triple A Rated   Banks through arbitrage will begin for a 21 day period.&nbsp; The contract process takes about a week and   a half as all signatures must be originals and go to each place that requires   filing of the contract such as the Law Society, HKMA, the Bank – HSBC or   Standard Charter, etc. as well as the SPV in the UK..&nbsp; If need be, the Directors can travel there   and sign in person to witness the whole process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            10)  After this agreement is   signed, a guaranteed amount is wired by bank contract payable in 21 to 30 days   or sooner, and also guaranteed by Lloyds of London PPI (Payment Protection   Insurance). &nbsp;Trading is for 10 days only   of the 21 days but it is for maximum profits called “Bullet Trades”; usually   at least 5% of the initial funds are profit per trade for the client.&nbsp; 30 Days is the maximum trading time except   for special cases where it might be extended for another 60 days additional.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            11)  A charity of choice is   usually linked to the profits of up to 10%. If you so agree, our Compliance   Director will engage and establish all financial reporting, filings, tax and   regulatory requirements for the UK SPV, and oversee all auditable reports to   the SPV for monthly reporting or weekly, if requested.
